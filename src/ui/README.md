Here I've placed each of the UI elements in the base of the UI directory,
but with a larger library, sub-directories would be required for organizing
the various components. In essence, I feel the UI library should be very
generalized and contain composable elements that can be applied wherever.

In this project I've put more context-specific components in a sub-directory
of the page requiring it.
